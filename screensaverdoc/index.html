<p > A Screensaver by definition is, "An animation or image that, after a set time, replaces an unchanging computer display." </p> 

<p > My assignment was to code a screensaver for my Studio Interaction class that I am taking in the Spring of 2017. </p> 

<p>  My screensaver is inspired from the way DNA is formed in our bodies. I have tried to recreate the structure of DNA moving and taking different forms and shapes. I have used bright and neon colours, such as blues, pinks and reds that alternatly change colours to represent the transitions of the different forms it can take. I have tried to focus on keeping a flow within the structure. </p>
